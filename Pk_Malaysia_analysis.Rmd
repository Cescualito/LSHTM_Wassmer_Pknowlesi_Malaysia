# **Background** 

Malaria, a life-threatening disease transmitted by mosquitoes and caused by *Plasmodium* parasites, presents a significant global health challenge. In 2022, it accounted for an estimated 249 million cases worldwide, resulting in approximately 608,000 deaths. Within Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, malaria remains a persistent public health concern, historically attributed to *Plasmodium falciparum* and *vivax* parasites. Despite successful national efforts to eliminate indigenous malaria cases in Malaysia since 2018, the emergence of *Plasmodium knowlesi* (*Pk*), previously confined to macaque monkeys but now infecting humans, has raised new alarms.

**Cerebral malaria** is one of the most severe forms of malaria infection, affecting the brain and often causing coma. Survivors can suffer from brain problems even after the infection is treated. While cerebral malaria is usually linked to *Plasmodium falciparum*, there have been cases where other types of Plasmodium parasites also caused severe brain issues. Recent research has shown that *Pk* infections in Southeast Asia can also lead to severe complications, sometimes even resulting in death. Post-mortem examinations in one fatal case of severe *Pk* infection revealed brain damage similar to that seen in cerebral malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*, even though *Pk* parasites don't usually bind to brain blood vessels like *Plasmodium falciparum* does.

Our own research has found brain changes in Indian patients with **severe malaria**, even if they didn't have coma. We observed higher levels of a protein associated with brain damage in these patients (**S100B**), along with kidney problems. This suggests that malaria can impact the brain, regardless of whether coma occurs, and kidney issues may worsen the situation. Despite similarities between cerebral malaria and severe *Pk* infections, and the frequent occurrence of kidney problems in severe *Pk* malaria, we still don't know much about how *Pk* infection affects the human brain. To address this gap, we studied biomarkers related to brain injury, blood vessel activity, and inflammation in Malaysian patients infected with *Pk* and compared them to healthy individuals.

# **Methodology**

## **Participants and samples**

This study utilized stored plasma samples collected during a larger project conducted in Peninsular Malaysia from December 2019 to January 2023. Adult patients exhibiting symptoms of malaria and seeking treatment at government hospitals or private clinics across several states in Malaysia were invited to participate. Additionally, community-matched, age-matched individuals without malaria were recruited from various communities in Malaysia. These individuals were considered part of high-risk groups, such as those working in or near forests, including farmers, hunters, and natural resource collectors.

Blood samples were collected after participants provided informed consent. All data were anonymised to protect participants' privacy. Malaria infection in each sample was confirmed using microscopic examination and molecular techniques. Out of the 50 individuals initially sampled, 38 had relevant clinical information available for this study, including parasitaemia levels, which our group has previously identified as an age-independent factor associated with severity in *falciparum* malaria. For this study, we analyzed de-identified samples from 19 infected patients and 19 healthy controls from Malaysia.

This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Research and Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health in Malaysia (**22-02557-1KV**) and by the Observational/Interventions Research Ethics Committee at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK (**27902**). The samples are registered with the Human Tissue Authority, in accordance with UK national guidelines.

Upon examination of histograms representing biomarker levels, it was evident that the distribution of most biomarkers deviates from normality. Given this, non-parametric statistical tests will be employed for group comparisons. By adopting this approach, we aimed to accurately assess differences in biomarker levels across teh two groups while minimizing the impact of non-normality on our analyses.

Similarly, upon inspection of density plots illustrating biomarker levels, it became apparent that the distribution of most biomarkers does not adhere to a normal distribution pattern.

**Brain injury biomarkers**

Bonferroni-corrected analyses revealed notable differences in plasma biomarker levels between *Pk*-infected individuals and uninfected controls. Specifically, the *Pk*-infected group exhibited significantly elevated levels of brain injury biomarkers such as **Tau**, **UCH-L1**, **αSyn**, **Park7**, **NRGN**, and **TDP-43**, whereas levels of **CaBD**, **CNTN1**, **NCAM-1**, **BDNF**, **GFAP**, and **KLK6** were significantly lower in the *Pk*-infected group. 

Plasma levels of **S100B** and **Aβ(1-42)** were mostly undetectable in uninfected subjects, whereas the *Pk*-infected group showed significantly higher proportions of detectable levels for both biomarkers. Adjustments were made for individuals with undetectable levels, revealing significantly higher plasma **S100B** levels in the *Pk*-infected group after correction for multiple comparisons. 

**Immune activation biomarkers**

Regarding biomarkers of infection and immune activation, levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines **IL-1RA** and **IL-10**, and pro-inflammatory cytokine **MPO**, were significantly higher in the *Pk*-infected group, while chemokines **CCL4** and **CCL5**, pro-inflammatory cytokine **CRP**, and **RAGE** levels were significantly lower. 

**Vascular biomarkers**

Endothelial activation biomarkers such as **Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio** and **VCAM-1** levels were significantly elevated in *Pk*-infected patients, while **Ang-1**, **BMP-9**, **PDGF-AA** and **-BB**, and **Serpin E1** levels were significantly lower.

![**Biomarkers of brain injury: Hierarchical clustering heatmap** *(right click to open full-size image in another tab/window)*](/home/cescualito/Dropbox/LABORAL/LSHTM/Wassmer Lab - Cesc Bertran-Cobo/Luminex/2023-05-09_Malaysia_samples/Analysis/Plots/Hierarchical clustering heatmap/Brain subset/Hierarchical clustering brain.png)

Hierarchical clustering heatmap analysis unveiled distinct group patterns for brain injury biomarkers, delineating cohesive clusters predominantly composed of infected individuals with elevated levels of **S100B**, **Park7**, **αSyn**, and **TDP-43**. Notably, two infected individuals displayed atypical clustering with the healthy controls, indicating a subgroup with a unique biomarker profile. Conversely, in the control group, certain biomarkers including **BDNF**, **CaBD**, **CNTN1**, and **GFAP** formed cohesive clusters with higher levels, representing a baseline biomarker profile in healthy individuals. However, two infected individuals clustered with the control group in this category, suggesting potential overlap or similarity in the levels of these specific biomarkers between infected and control individuals.

### **Immune biomarker subset** 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
Pk_Malaysia_final_immune_subset_list <- c(
  "CRP", "GM-CSF", "IFNγ", "IL-1α", "IL-1β", "IL-2", "IL-6", "IL-8",
  "IL-17", "MIF", "MPO", "TNF-α", "IL-1RA", "IL-4", "IL-10",
  "CCL2", "CCL4", "CCL5", "CCL18", "OPN", "RAGE"
)

Pk_Malaysia_final_immune_subset <- Pk_Malaysia_final %>% select(Participants, Pk_Malaysia_final_immune_subset_list)

row.names(Pk_Malaysia_final_immune_subset) <- Pk_Malaysia_final_immune_subset$Participants
Pk_Malaysia_final_immune_subset$Participants <- NULL

Pk_Malaysia_final_immune_subset[is.na(Pk_Malaysia_final_immune_subset)] <- 0 # Replace NAs with zeros
Pk_Malaysia_final_immune_subset <- scale(Pk_Malaysia_final_immune_subset) # Scale data 

Pk_Malaysia_final_immune_subset_dist <- dist(Pk_Malaysia_final_immune_subset) # Base R code
Pk_Malaysia_final_immune_subset_hclust <- hclust(Pk_Malaysia_final_immune_subset_dist)
plot(Pk_Malaysia_final_immune_subset_hclust)

Clustering analysis of biomarkers associated with infection and immune activation did not reveal distinct separation between the two groups. Higher levels of **IL-1RA** and **MPO** predominantly clustered in the infected group, with two control individuals exhibiting similar patterns. Additionally, one infected individual displayed notably high levels of **IL-1β**, **GM-CSF**, **TNF-α**, **CCL4**, and **CCL2**, while another exhibited elevated levels of **OPN** and **IL-10**. Furthermore, one control individual showed high levels of **IL-6**.

### **Vascular biomarker subset** 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
Pk_Malaysia_final_vascular_subset_list <- c(
  "Ang-1", "Ang-2", "Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio", "BMP-9", "ICAM-1",
  "PDGF AA", "PDGF BB", "Serpin E1", "VCAM-1", "VEGF", "vWF"
)

Pk_Malaysia_final_vascular_subset <- Pk_Malaysia_final %>% select(Participants, Pk_Malaysia_final_vascular_subset_list)

row.names(Pk_Malaysia_final_vascular_subset) <- Pk_Malaysia_final_vascular_subset$Participants
Pk_Malaysia_final_vascular_subset$Participants <- NULL

Pk_Malaysia_final_vascular_subset[is.na(Pk_Malaysia_final_vascular_subset)] <- 0 # Replace NAs with zeros
Pk_Malaysia_final_vascular_subset <- scale(Pk_Malaysia_final_vascular_subset) # Scale data 

Pk_Malaysia_final_vascular_subset_dist <- dist(Pk_Malaysia_final_vascular_subset) # Base R code
Pk_Malaysia_final_vascular_subset_hclust <- hclust(Pk_Malaysia_final_vascular_subset_dist)
plot(Pk_Malaysia_final_vascular_subset_hclust)

pheatmap(Pk_Malaysia_final_vascular_subset, cutree_rows = 2, cutree_cols = 2,  scale = "none")
```

Lastly, clustering of vascular biomarkers exhibited clear and distinctive group profiles. In the control group, a cohesive cluster characterized by high levels of **PDGF-AA**, **Ang-1**, **PDGF-BB**, **Serpin E1**, and **BMP-9** was observed. Conversely, in the infected group, a distinct cluster with higher levels of **VCAM-1** and the **Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio** was identified.

## **Biomarker correlation with age** 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
Pk_Malaysia_age <- Pk_Malaysia_plots %>%    
  ggplot(aes(y = Levels, x = age, color=status, group = sample_ID)) +
